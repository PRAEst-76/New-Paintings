# New-Paintings

New paintings for use in creating location mods for Daggerfall Unity.

## Note on art-style

I can't paint. Certainly not to a hang-it-in-your-home-in-a-frame level. These are created using AI art based on my own family photos to avoid rights issues. I've tried to stick to a dark fantasy style. They are designed to create an atmosphere, not to be enjoyed individually, as they are somewhat ropey. Enjoy them out of the corner of your eye while telling Bedistair Moorsly his brother was eaten by an ogre. **Don't look at them directly!** *This is what Sheograth wants.*
